# Personal Website
Just the code for my [personal website](https://zackakil.com) that just serves as a hub for my other social links (🤷 for SEO). 


It used to have machine learning in it to draw/generate the title text ([github repo for that project](https://github.com/ZackAkil/webpage-autoencoder)).

Using Github pages with a custom domain for hosting.
